# dictionary-app
JS dictionary simple app using dictionaryapi.dev as API.

Using a free API, called dictionaryapi i've create this simple app, where you can type any word inside a textbox, and when you click on enter, shows up the meaning of the word on screen.
With an async JS function, I make a request to the API, and catch all the data in the UI, such as the meaning, phonetics, and all the synonyms that the request have feched, parsing it from a JSON format, to the UI.
Made with responsive design, using Media Queries.

Technologies used:
<li> HTML </li>
<li> CSS </li>
<li> Vanilla JS </li>
